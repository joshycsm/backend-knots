knot1 = Knot.create(name:"Alpine Butterfly Loop ", description:"What is now known as the Alpine Butterfly Loop was described twice by Ashley: Lineman’s Loop (ABOK # 1053, p 191); and Harness Loop (ABOK # 532, p 87). It provides a secure loop in the middle of a piece of rope. Load can be safely applied: from the loop to either end of the rope; between the two ends with the loop hanging free; or to the loop with the load spread between the two ends.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/alpinebutterfly/alpinebutterflyR12.jpg") 
knot2 = Knot.create(name:"Bowline Knot", description:"The Bowline (ABOK # 1010, p 186) makes a reasonably secure loop in the end of a piece of rope. It has many uses, e.g., to fasten a mooring line to a ring or a post.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/bowline/bowlineR7.jpg")
knot3 = Knot.create(name:"Clove Hitch – Rope End", description:" The Clove Hitch (ABOK # 1245, p 224) was, originally, included here with the intention of condemning it. It does have two giant faults: it slips and, paradoxically, can also bind. It should be deeply distrusted when used by itself.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/cloveend/cloveendR7.jpg")
knot4 = Knot.create(name:"Distel Hitch", description:"The Distel Hitch is a slide and grip knot used to ascend a climbing rope. It is tied using a lanyard with a loop in each end. Although any safe end-loop would be acceptable, each loop is usually a Poacher’s Knot, a loop secured with a Double Overhand Knot around the lanyard.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/distel/distelR13.jpg")
knot5 = Knot.create(name:"Double Fisherman’s Bend", description:"The Double Fisherman’s, or Grapevine, Bend (ABOK # 294, p 50.) consists of two Strangle Knots (like double overhand knots) each tied round the other standing end. However, because it is created around another line, this structure may not be obvious.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/doublefishermans/doublefishermansR16.jpg")
knot6 = Knot.create(name:"Double Overhand Stopper", description:"The Double Overhand Stopper Knot (ABOK # 516, p 84) is based on the Overhand Knot with one additional turn. It creates a reliable, moderately large, stopper knot.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/doubleoverhand/doubleoverhandR8.jpg")
knot7 = Knot.create(name:"Figure 8 Bend", description:"The Figure 8 Bend, or Flemish Bend (ABOK # 1411, p 258.) provides a safe, and simple way to join two ropes. It is reasonably easy to remember, tie, and check.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/fig8join/fig8joinR10.jpg")
knot8 = Knot.create(name:"Figure 8 Directional Loop", description:"Ashley describes the Directional Figure 8 Knot as the second of two examples of a “Single Bowline on the Bight” (ABOK # 1058, p 191). It creates a loop in the middle of a rope and is used as a load-bearing knot by climbers to take strain in one direction only.", image:"https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/fig8directional/fig8directionalR6.jpg")
